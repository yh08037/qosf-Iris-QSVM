# QOSF Cohort 7 Screening Tasks
## Task 3: QSVM
Generate a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) using the iris dataset and try to propose a kernel from a parametric quantum circuit to classify the three classes(setosa, versicolor, virginica) using the one-vs-all format, the kernel only works as binary classification. Identify the proposal with the lowest number of qubits and depth to obtain higher accuracy. You can use the UUâ€  format or using the Swap-Test.
